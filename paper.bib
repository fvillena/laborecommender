	abstract = {Background: Among the variables that inﬂuence medical decisions, laboratory tests are considered to be among the most important and frequently used. The inﬂuence of laboratory tests on medical decisions has been difﬁcult to estimate. The goal of this study was to estimate the number of patient encounters that included a laboratory test.
Methods: We extracted information for 72 196 patient encounters from 1-week intervals each quarter of a year from our comprehensive academic medical center electronic medical record. The patients examined represent a comprehensive range of clinical conditions and medical services. We determined for which encounters laboratory and other orders existed.
Results: Overall 35\% of encounters had 1 or more laboratory tests ordered. However, the percent varied markedly with patient care areas. For inpatient, emergency department, and outpatient populations, 98\%, 56\%, and 29\%, respectively, had 1 or more laboratory tests ordered.
Conclusions: Our observations support that it is not possible to use a single number to categorize the frequency with which laboratory tests occur in patient encounters. Utilization of laboratory tests varied with type of medical service with almost all inpatients, approximately half of emergency department patients, and nearly one-third of outpatients having laboratory tests during their healthcare visit.},

	abstract = {Background
Laboratory testing is the single highest-volume medical activity and drives clinical decision-making across medicine. However, the overall landscape of inappropriate testing, which is thought to be dominated by repeat testing, is unclear. Systematic differences in initial vs. repeat testing, measurement criteria, and other factors would suggest new priorities for improving laboratory testing.

Methods
A multi-database systematic review was performed on published studies from 1997–2012 using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Over- vs. underutilization, initial vs. repeat testing, low- vs. high-volume testing, subjective vs. objective appropriateness criteria, and restrictive vs. permissive appropriateness criteria, among other factors, were assessed.

Results
Overall mean rates of over- and underutilization were 20.6\% (95\% CI 16.2–24.9\%) and 44.8\% (95\% CI 33.8–55.8\%). Overutilization during initial testing (43.9\%; 95\% CI 35.4–52.5\%) was six times higher than during repeat testing (7.4\%; 95\% CI 2.5–12.3\%; P for stratum difference {\textless}0.001). Overutilization of low-volume tests (32.2\%; 95\% CI 25.0–39.4\%) was three times that of high-volume tests (10.2\%; 95\% CI 2.6–17.7\%; P{\textless}0.001). Overutilization measured according to restrictive criteria (44.2\%; 95\% CI 36.8–51.6\%) was three times higher than for permissive criteria (12.0\%; 95\% CI 8.0–16.0\%; P{\textless}0.001). Overutilization measured using subjective criteria (29.0\%; 95\% CI 21.9–36.1\%) was nearly twice as high as for objective criteria (16.1\%; 95\% CI 11.0–21.2\%; P = 0.004). Together, these factors explained over half (54\%) of the overall variability in overutilization. There were no statistically significant differences between studies from the United States vs. elsewhere (P = 0.38) or among chemistry, hematology, microbiology, and molecular tests (P = 0.05–0.65) and no robust statistically significant trends over time.

Conclusions
The landscape of overutilization varies systematically by clinical setting (initial vs. repeat), test volume, and measurement criteria. Underutilization is also widespread, but understudied. Expanding the current focus on reducing repeat testing to include ordering the right test during initial evaluation may lead to fewer errors and better care.},

To determine the effectiveness of order sets in improving guideline adherence, treatment outcomes, processes of care, efficiency, and cost, we conducted a systematic review of the literature.Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed in various databases for studies published between January 1, 1990, and April 18, 2009. A total of eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. No randomized controlled trials were found.Results: Outcomes of the included studies were summarized qualitatively due to variations in study population, intervention type, and outcome measures. There were no important inconsistencies between the results reported by studies involving different types of order sets. While the studies generally suggested positive outcomes, they were typically of low quality, with simple before-after designs and other methodological limitations.Conclusions: The benefits of order sets remain eminently plausible, but given the paucity of high quality evidence, further investigations to formally evaluate the effectiveness of order sets would be highly valuable.},

	abstract = {Background: As a prevalent metabolic disease, diabetes has different side effects and causes a wide range of co morbidity with a high rate of mortality. There is a need for certain interventions to manage this disease. Iranians usually have three main meals a day. Considering the special needs of diabetic patients and the possibility of hypoglycemia between the main meals, it is essential for these patients to eat something as a snack. Considering these conditions and the society’s orientation towards modern technologies such as smart phones, designing mobile-based nutrition recommender systems can be helpful. Methods: The snack recommender system is a knowledge-based smart phone application. This study has focused on the development of a recommender system that combines artificial intelligence techniques and makes up a knowledge base according to the guidelines posed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The snack menu was recommended in accordance with the patient’s favorites and conditions. The accuracy of the recommended menu was assessed in 2 steps. First, it was compared with the diet prescribed by three nutrition specialists. In the second step, system’s suggested menu was evaluated by the data from 30 diabetic patients using a valid questionnaire. Results: The results of evaluating the snack recommender system by nutritionists showed that this system is capable of recommending various snacks according to the season (accuracy of 100\%) and personal interests (accuracy of 90\%) to diabetic patients. According to health nutritionists, the snacks suggested by this system are matched with Iranian culture. Moreover, the results revealed that a higher body mass index (BMI) makes the recommender system less sensitive to personal interests to suggest what is basically beneficial for one’s health. Conclusion: This study was a pioneering research to develop a more comprehensive dietary recommender system for diabetic patients which includes main meals as well. Patients found the system useful and were satisfied with the application. This system is believed to be able to help diabetic patients to take more healthy diet which leads to a better lifestyle.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, hospitals have been collecting a large amount of health related digital data for patients. This includes clinical test reports, treatment updates and disease diagnosis. The information extracted from f this data is used for clinical decisions and treatment recommendations. Among health recommender systems, collaborative ﬁltering technique has gained a signiﬁcant success. However, traditional collaborative ﬁltering o algorithms are facing challenges such as data sparsity and scalability, which leads to a reduction in system accuracy and eﬃciency. In a clinical setting, the recommendations should be accurate and timely. In this paper, an improvised collaborative ﬁltering technique is proposed, which is based on clustering and subo clustering. The proposed methodology is applied on a supervised set of data for four diﬀerent types of r cardiovascular diseases including angina, non-cardiac chest pain, silent ischemia, and myocardial infarction. The patient data is partitioned with respect to their corresponding disease class, which is followed by k-mean clustering, applied separately on each disease partition. A query patient once directed to the correct disease p partition requires to get similarity scores from a reduced sub-cluster, thereby improving the eﬃciency of the - system. Each disease partition has a separate process for recommendation, which gives rise to modularization and helps in improving scalability of the system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed e modular clustering based recommender system reduces the spatial search domain for a query patient and the time required for providing accurate recommendations. The proposed system improves upon the accuracy r of recommendations as demonstrated by the precision and recall values. This is signiﬁcant for health recommendation systems particularly for those related to cardiovascular diseases.},
